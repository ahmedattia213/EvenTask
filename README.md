# EvenTask
Event Based Task Management

I'm working in this as a side project for handling my tasks list in an events and dependencies based way with an option to assist me in my week plan. 

I’m trying to make this an architecture and testing playground.

DM me if you’re interested to join me in this project, you can also check the code and the open issues.
